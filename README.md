# 📊 Data Visualizations

Welcome!  
This repository contains reproducible code and datasets for data visualizations I share on social media. 
I’m a sociologist and demographer focusing on **family demography, aging, and population health** — and I believe good data storytelling can better inform us.

## 🎯 Purpose

These charts are designed to:
- **Cut through noise** — one clear message per visual
- **Connect data to people** — it’s not just a number, it’s “this affects your job, your kids, your loved ones, your bank account.”
- **Be shareable** — optimized for social media formats 
- **Stay transparent** — with documented data sources and reproducible R code.
