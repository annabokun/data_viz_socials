# ðŸ“Š Data Visualizations

Welcome!  
This repository contains reproducible code and datasets for data visualizations I share on social media. 
Iâ€™m a sociologist and demographer focusing on **family demography, aging, and population health** â€” and I believe good data storytelling can better inform.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These charts are designed to:
- **Cut through noise** â€” one clear message per visual.
- **Connect data to people** â€” focusing on topics with human impact.
- **Be shareable** â€” optimized for social media formats (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram).
- **Stay transparent** â€” with documented data sources and reproducible code.
